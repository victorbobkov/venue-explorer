# Venue Explorer Bot
![Poster Image](poster.jpg)

## Project Overview
Venue Explorer Bot is a Telegram Mini App that allows users to explore and find venues based on different categories. Users can view details about the venues and mark their favorite ones. The project is developed as part of Telegram's Mini App development contest and serves as a reusable example for future Mini App developers.

### Features
- Explore venues by category
- View detailed information about each venue
- Booking Confirmation: After selecting a venue, users can proceed to book it. The Booking Confirmation page displays the details of the booking and provides options for modification and confirmation
- Mark venues as favorites

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js: Ensure Node.js is installed. [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)
- Telegram App: Installed on your device. [Download Telegram](https://telegram.org/apps)

### Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/victorbobkov/venue-explorer
```

### Backend Setup
Navigate to the backend directory, install the required packages, and start the server:

```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm start
```

### Frontend Setup
Similarly, for the frontend:
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

#### Deployment Configuration (vercel.json)
When deploying to Vercel, a `vercel.json` configuration file is used to manage the routing behaviors and other deployment settings for the project.

The provided configuration in this project primarily ensures that the SPA routes correctly, addressing a known issue where reloading on a subroute would result in a 404 error.

The configuration contains rules for handling asset requests (such as images, stylesheets, and scripts), directing them to their corresponding resources, and any other path is directed to the `index.html` file, allowing the React router to handle the route client-side. This resolves the reloading error on subroutes by always serving the `index.html` on any path and can influence performance due to client-side routing and handling.

## Usage
